Clustering is a type of unsupervised machine learning technique that groups similar data points into clusters based on shared characteristics or patterns. The goal is to identify inherent structures within the data without prior labels or classifications. Clustering algorithms, such as K-Means or DBSCAN, categorize data into distinct groups where data points within the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. The number of clusters and the method of grouping depend on the specific algorithm and the nature of the data.

In financial data analysis, clustering can be used to segment different financial entities (e.g., companies, customers, or transactions) into distinct groups based on similar financial behaviors or attributes. For instance, clustering can help to identify groups of customers with similar spending patterns, classify stocks based on financial performance, or categorize businesses with similar financial health. By leveraging clustering, analysts can uncover hidden patterns, detect anomalies, and make data-driven decisions. This segmentation allows for targeted strategies in areas like marketing, risk management, and investment portfolio management.
